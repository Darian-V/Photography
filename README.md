## The Monarch

I took this photo in my backyard where we have milkweed.  Every Spring we get to see the butterflies come and lay their eggs leading to Monarch butterflies.  The one in the photo was one that hatched in our backyard.  

## The Cat

I took this photo at home of my own cat.  These photos were taken when I first started taking photos with a DSLR and was learning how to play with lighting and how each setting interacted with the photo.

This photo was taken on a camping trip I went to. This was my first experience taking night photography and I really enjoy how the photos turned out.
